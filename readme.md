# ButterBean Lesson #1 Example Plugin

This is an example plugin to show how [ButterBean](https://github.com/justintadlock/butterbean) works.  

For the tutorial associated with this example plugin, see: : http://themehybrid.com/weblog/butterbean-lesson-1-the-basics

For the purposes of the tutorial series, I'm not packaging ButterBean with each example plugin.  You can install it as a standalone plugin just for testing this.
